I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. <strong>The Discord&nbsp;community should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a efficient self learner. </strong><br></p><p><strong>To join the group,&nbsp;go </strong><a href="https://discord.gg/kDsZfGc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>to this link here.</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;Once there,&nbsp;you can sign up and click on channels to explore different topics.&nbsp; </strong><br><br>I'll see you inside!!<br><br><br>(Thanks to Pavel, a fellow student, for contributing the below icon)!</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/kDsZfGc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Join by clicking here: https://discord.gg/kDsZfGc</strong></a><br><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-04-30_11-16-17-6fd45185cec533f952726fc84729768b.png"></figure><p><br></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>

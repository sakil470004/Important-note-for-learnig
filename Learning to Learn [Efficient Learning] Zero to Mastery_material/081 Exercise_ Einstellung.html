Ask yourself, "what is Option C?" in this riddle:<br><br><strong>Water Jug Problem (which became famous from the movie Die Hard 3):<br></strong>You've got to defuse a bomb by placing exactly 4 gallons (15 L) of water on a sensor. The problem is, you only have a 5 gallon (18.9 L) jug and a 3 gallons (11 L) jug on hand! This classic riddle, made famous in Die Hard 3, may seem impossible without a measuring cup, but it is actually remarkably simple.<br><br>Try to solve this yourself. <br><br>You can find the answer to the riddle <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-the-Water-Jug-Riddle-from-Die-Hard-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here with a step by step guide</a>, or you can even watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the clip from Die Hard 3</a> where this is used. <br><br>I always like writing down "What is Option C" at the bottom of all my notes when learning something new to be reminded of this effect. </p></p></div></div></div></body></html>

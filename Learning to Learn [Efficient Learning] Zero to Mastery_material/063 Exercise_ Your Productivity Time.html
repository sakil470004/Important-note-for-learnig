For example, I am a morning person and my most productive hours are between 7am and 12pm. I also sometimes like to work in the afternoon, but I have a cutoff of 5pm. No matter how much work I need to do, how many deadlines I have, at 5pm I have an endpoint that I always follow. <br><br>Combining your productivity time, with your endpoint time, you now give your brain a rest for worrying and planning. Your productivity time may change day to day. Maybe you have small endpoints throughout the day for small tasks. But no matter what, you have an absolute work/learning endpoint at 5pm (or whatever time you decide).</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>

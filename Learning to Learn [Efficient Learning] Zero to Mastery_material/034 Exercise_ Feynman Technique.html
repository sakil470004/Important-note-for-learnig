If you have been following along and taking notes on your own or in our worksheets, you should have something now to be able to teach or show others your work. <br><br>Moving forward, on top of taking notes, <strong>I want you to start thinking of these notes as "shareable" notes that you are going to share at the end of the course. </strong>This means you can use something like <a href="https://docs.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Google Docs</strong></a><strong> </strong>to share with the ZTM community, you can use something like<strong> </strong><a href="https://medium.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Medium</strong></a> to share what you learned in a blog post, or you can share your filled in worksheet online. <br><br>The idea is to take notes in the course in a way that at the end of it all, you can teach what you have learned to your friends, family, or even people on the internet. It sounds tedious, but as you will find out, this works to help ideas stick. We will revisit this exercise at the end of the course and see if these notes are shareable!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
